<h2>About Us!</h2>
<h3>Awe Inspiring Dining Experience</h3>
<p><img src="images/sushi bar.jpg" alt="sushibar">With our elaborate resturant design and many staff members awaiting for you to cater to. We offer only the most premium of fish and ingrediants. Since opening our sushi cafe we've wanted to create a place where people can go to and wind down with an expansive drink menu. Most of our fish are from either the great lakes or from freshly delivered from chicago. As stated many times before we take pride in our food and will only serve the best. None of that "Fresh Frozen" BS! So please take a chance and try us out! We promise not to dissapoint!</p>
