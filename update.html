<h2>Paul's Sushi & Cafe Updates!</h2>
<h3>COVID Precautions still in place due to Delta Variant. Please be safe!</h3>
<p><img src="images/reddragon.jpg" alt="red dragon roll ready to go"> We are 120% dedicated to keeping you and your loved ones safe during this pandemic. Our employees have been wiping down hotspot areas with anti-bacterial sprays and have been enforcing our employees to wear masks again due to the delta variant. Customers are allowed to be maskless throughout their entire experience unless unvaccinated. <hr>
Our fish are only the freshest and prepared with perfection! The cuts are immaculate and the taste is just pure bliss. If you are new to town then you found the best spot in the area for only the best. Take a look at our *Red Dragon Roll! Made with Avocado and Shrimp Tempura, topped with our special grade spicy tuna and scallions.</p>

<h3>Mark your calendars!</h3>
<p><img src="images/cal.jpg" alt="sushi"> Our resturant family and staff will be taking a one week vacation from August 12th to August 17th! During this time the establishment will be closed! We are sorry for any inconveience this might have caused but we will be back refreshed and ready to serve our customers even better! We hope you all have a nice rest of your summer!<hr>*NOTE: We are currently out of White Tuna due to the supply chain issues, we are looking to have a fresh shipment in by the end of this week! Thank you for your understanding. </p>
